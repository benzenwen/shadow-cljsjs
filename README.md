# shadow-cljs - CLJSJS compat

Provides a mapping of CLJSJS packages back to their original npm package.

shadow-cljs will compile npm directly and does not need the pre-bundled packages CLJSJS provides.

You do not need to add this package to your dependencies manually, `shadow-cljs` will already provide it.
